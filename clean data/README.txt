## Correction

The files "pop-inc-rent-rc-if-allyear-clean.xlsx" and "pop-inc-rent-rc-if-allyear.xlsx" have better structure to read. However, I give worng rent control labels between the same-name city and county. The corrected version is in "pop-inc-rent-rc-if-allyear-cleaner-correct.CSV"

About rent control rating

	1: Rent Control and Just Cause - These cities have both rent stabilization and just cause protections. The laws do exempt (exclude) some units, but far fewer than other laws. 
	2: Weakened Rent Control and Just Cause - Tenants in these cities once had strong protections. But because the laws allow landlords to have their units be permanently exempted from the protections very easily, the total number of protected tenants is diminishing at a very rapid pace. 
	3: Only Rent Control or only Just Cause  - Tenants in cities that only have just cause are protected from unjust evictions, but are not at all protected from rent hikes. Similarly, tenants in cities that only have rent control are not protected at all from unjust evictions even though landlords cannot raise the rent unjustly. In both cities tenants remain at risk of displacement, either by means of unreasonable rent increases, or unjust evictions. These policies are most effective when they are enacted together.
	4. No Rent Control
